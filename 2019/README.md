# 2019 Survey Data

Current data layout mirrors the 2018 fields collected, however, the survey was
updated to capture more information about bonus structures. This means that
2018 analysis is portable to 2019 for the time being, but expect that it will
break once the new fields are added.

## Added fields

The objective in adding the new fileds was to capture the bonuses that are
"promised", but depend on multiple factors. A "promised" bonus of 15% of base
salary that is never acheived, or gamed through business metrics does not
reflect actual compensation. Knowing this information can be helpful when
reviewing offers that are structured in this manner.
